# Fast-Prototype-Unity3D

Game's name: iSheepYouNot

A fast prototype of a game idea using any commercial engine in order to create quick gameplay ideas, but most importantly to familiarize ourselves with that engine. The main goal of that was many objects either get attached to you on collision or start following you.

My approach is for the objest to start following me on collision and i succeed that using pathfinding.
